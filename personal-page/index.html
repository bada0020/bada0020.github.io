		<p> DIMA for design was established by Dima Badawi, a freelance graphic designer from Syria. Dima's story with design started in 2009 when she left Journalism and Media school in Damascus. When realizing that expressing herself in this country through journalism will be limited, she changed paths and registered in the Arab International University in Damascus to major in Fine Arts.

She was introduced to Graphic Design as a general elective. Her passion and interest in the subject grew and so did her desire to learn more about visual communication and branding. Her professors called her "a fresh talent", and her career in graphic design lay in forming her foundation in a good design school. She later moved to Canada, where she now majors in Graphic Design at Algonquin College in Ottawa, Ontario.
